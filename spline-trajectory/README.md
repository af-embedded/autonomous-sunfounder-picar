## BezierSplineCreator
This is a class for creating BeziÃ©r splanes.

### Dependencies
math (standard lib)
numpy
matplotlib

### How-To
There is a virtual environment set up for this class (using pipenv). 
This makes it easier to not bloat your own python instance with a lot of different modules.
To run this with pipenv your first need to install pipenv.
> pip install --user pipenv
When that has been made run the example script with
> pipenv run python spline_test.py
This should first install the needed modules and then run the script.
