## BezierSplineCreator
This is a class for creating BÃ©zier splanes.
A nice illustration of what that is can be found [here.](https://javascript.info/bezier-curve)

### Dependencies
* math (standard lib)
* numpy
* matplotlib

### How-To
There is a virtual environment set up in order to run the example script (using [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
This makes it easier to not bloat your own python instance with a lot of different modules.
To run this with pipenv your first need to install pipenv.
> pip install --user pipenv

When that has been made run the example script with

> pipenv run python spline_test.py

This should first install the needed modules and then run the script.
